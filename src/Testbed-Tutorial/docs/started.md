# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with an account on the website, join a project, or request to be added to an existing project.

## Step 1: Login in the MENTORED Testbed

After accessing the portal, you will see the login screen. In the center of the screen, there will be login options available. If your institution is a member of RNP (most research and education institutions in Brazil are part of it), or if you have a Google account, you can log in with your institutional or Google credentials through the federated login.

<!-- After logging in, you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions of use. Please be sure to read them carefully before accepting. -->

Once logged in, you will be redirected to a page where you must create a project or log in in order to take advantage of all the features available in the MENTORED Testbed.

## Step 2: Create or join a project

To access MENTORED Testbed resources, you need to be associated with a project, either by your own creation or by the allocation of the responsible researcher.

If you want to join an existing MENTORED Testbed project, you will need to ask the Project Administrator to assign your account access to the project. 

## Step 3: Begin using the MENTORED Testbed!

After following these steps, you will be ready to enjoy all the features that MENTORED Testbed offers. With your account registered, you can start new projects or select existing ones, and finally, create and run your own experiments. Good Work!
