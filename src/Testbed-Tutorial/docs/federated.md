The Federated Academic Community (CAFe) program, maintained and made available by the National Research Network (RNP), brings together Brazilian education and research institutions to facilitate access to various technological resources offered by the federation's member institutions.

To access resources remotely via CAFe, the institution must be part of the Federated Academic Community, a service that RNP maintains to provide authentication and information exchange facilities. Joining, maintaining, and providing information on users, as well as authentication, is the responsibility of the institution.
